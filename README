This is a fast-efficient shadowsocks local deployment solution on Ubuntu
Approximately 70% Speed Up & 80% Delay Down & 90% sslocal Stability Up than my experience of pure python-shadowsocks. (ye pain in the *)

Mainly the improvement happened when ss-libev provided an ACL rules function so we can bypass unnecessary proxy requests and get out the hell of massive requests of py-ss

Simply a similar implement as Shadowsocks-Android (but that uses tun2sock/vpn-if not simple polipo)

This version of ss-libev and related modules is compiled and build under the instruction @https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-libev. Appreciation!
